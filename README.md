# Task Tracker API Module: Simple Kanban for Individual Productivity

The Task Tracker API module, inspired by the simplicity of a Kanban system, is specifically crafted for individual users
seeking an efficient solution for task management and productivity. This module provides a user-friendly interface
designed to streamline personal workflows and enhance organization.

Use Cases:

* Personal Projects: Effectively manage tasks related to personal projects, hobbies, or side ventures.

* Freelance Work: Stay organized with a dedicated space for tracking freelance tasks, deadlines, and project details.

* Daily Task Management: Enhance daily productivity by visualizing and prioritizing tasks for personal and professional
  growth.

## Authentication

Authentication is performed using JWT with refresh tokens and 256-bit encryption.

During the process of authentication, registration, or token refresh, a valid response will contain a token response
like the following:

```json
{
  "access_token": "",
  "refresh_token": ""
}
```

The output is a JSON object with two fields: `access_token` and `refresh_token`. Authentication occurs only with the
first
token because the `refresh_token` includes the `is_refresh_token` header, preventing its use for authentication. The
refresh
token is exclusively used for updating the main token.

Example authorization header:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}
```

## Database

In this project, we have Postgres as the database management system to efficiently store and manage our data.
The relational database design is illustrated in the diagram below:
